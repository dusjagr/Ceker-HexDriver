# Ceker-HexDriver

The 4 different sized HexDrivers symbolize the effort of Pakde Marcjono to promote and develop open hardware tools and open scientific instruments in different cultural contexts. To learn programming 3D-models with parametrized design using the software OpenSCAD, an example was chosen of a HexDriver to fasten nuts of various sizes (M6, M8, M10, M12) using a plastic material, that will not scratch the underlying surface. Continuing a running gag with the local friends "Chicken are not Foot" a handle was chosen representing the "ceker" as a symbol of intercultural cuisine discussions; otherness, disgust, delicacy and humour.
